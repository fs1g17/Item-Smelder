# Item-Smelder
TF2 is my favourite online FPS game. There are 9 playable classes in the game, each with their own weapons. Players are randomly given weapons in the game, each weapon having it's own perks and drawbacks. Some weapons can be used by multiple classes. 2 weapons used by the same class can be combined to make scrap metal, which in turn can be used to create more weapons or sold on the market. I created this project to find the optimal smelding process to create the maximum number of scrap metal.

Above are examples of the output. On the left is a visual example, and on the right is text-based. These are interpreted as instructions, which weapons to combine to produce scrap.
